# @recast-navigation/wasm

WASM build of Recast Navigation.

This library isn't intended for direct use - [`@recast-navigation/core`](https://github.com/isaac-mason/recast-navigation-js/tree/main/packages/recast-navigation-core) is probably what you're looking for. It uses `@recast-navigation/wasm` internally, and provides a more friendly API.

This WASM build is based on the [Babylon.js Recast Navigation Extension](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Extensions/tree/master/recastjs).
